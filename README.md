*Machine Translation with mT5*
This project involves training a multilingual sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural network for language translation using the mT5 model from Hugging Face's transformers library. The dataset used is the ALT dataset, which includes translations in multiple languages.

Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a neural translation model that can translate between multiple languages. The model is based on the mT5 transformer architecture, which is designed for multilingual text generation tasks. The project includes data loading and preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.

Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required packages. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages such as transformers, sentencepiece, datasets, ipywidgets, keras, torch, torchvision, and torchaudio installed.

Usage
Dataset Preparation The project uses the ALT dataset. Ensure that the dataset is correctly loaded and split into training and testing sets.

Tokenizer and Model Initialization
Initialize the tokenizer and model, adding special tokens for each language.

Training
The training loop involves encoding the inputs and targets, creating data generators, and training the model with checkpoints. The optimizer and learning rate scheduler are also set up to manage the training process.

Evaluation
Evaluate the model on the test dataset to determine its performance. This involves running the model on unseen data and calculating the loss.

Saving the Model
After training, save the trained model to a specified path for future use.
